            <strong>Air Pollution</strong> in China has affect lots of people's life. Children cannot go to school
            and lots of people get lung problem beacuse of it. I have an idea in mind to report the daily pollution
            index to let people to be more awared of it and try to help to reduce it.

            <strong>Coffee</strong> is a major product of Columbia. We can build a platform to introduce
            the details about coffee in Columbia. This can let more and more people to know
            about the growth environment of coca beans in Columbia and the traditional technology of
            processing coffee beans etc. It also can be a trade platform. If people from
            other country would like to buy the original Columbia coffee, they can order
            directly from Columbia coffee makers.
