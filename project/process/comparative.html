               <p> This website is intent on introuducing details of coffee from colombia. It contains most of informations I need
               for my topic. I think the audience of this website would be someone very interest about the histroy of colombia
               coffee and the procedure to produce the famous colombia coffee; however, most of the content of this websites
               are text which may cost lots of times for users to read all of them. The website is not responsive, so it might be very
               hard to browse it on mobile devices.</p>

         </header>
         <section>
               <p>This website has covered more informations about coffee around all over the world than the previous one. It also has
               trade platfrom for users to buy coffee from world. Compare to the previous website, this one contains more pictures and
               videos which is more interesting for users to browse. It is also a responsive website.</p>

         </section>
         <p>I think I would combine the adventages of these two websites, such as the specific details introduced in Cafe de Colombia and
         the formalization of Cafe Imports to bring more interesting and comprehensive informations about colombia coffee for the users. I
         also want to build an phone application to be more accessable on mobile devices</p>
