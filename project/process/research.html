            <p> Architecture is a part of culture heritage, so I decide to study more on this topic. The three website that I chose to use as research for my project that introduced the histroy of modern architecture. My goal of this project was to introduce more information about these architecture to the world. This project would let people be conscious of protecting them.
            </p>
            <p>The first website I decided to use is an brief introduction about the timeline of the modern architecture develipment. For example, many different branch of architecture such as BAUHAUS, EXPRESSIONISM and DE STIJL were founded during the period between wars. It also had mentioned some information about some hand craft furnitures.</p>
            <p>The second website I used  was shows more details about the history of architectures around the world. It also used some interactive 360 camera to show the examples of different representative architecture in different regions. This site gives me more hints about how to find wider field of vision for audience. I think a interactive map would help audience to dig into the topic.</p>
            <p>The last website I found has an interesting view point. It made a connection between movies and architectures. It is fun and easy to get attention from audiences. If the audiences have watch those movies, they might be more likely to find out the information of the architecture showed in movies. I believe it is a good way to arouse audience’s interest about architectures.
</p>
            <p>All this website presented the information in an inefficient way. The experience of browsing these websites was not good. I would like to generate a more interactive website to let audience to have the best way to get knowledge from it.</p>
