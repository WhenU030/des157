         </header>
         <section>
               <p> The Glassdoor is a job searching website. The searching bar is on the very top of the homepage
               which gives it the highest priority. There are four secitons for different searching areas for users
               to choose. Each of them have placeholder in the text enter area to guide user what to enter. Its color
               has followed color trend of the entire website. The most important function of a jor searching website
               is searching. It's design is quite simple; therefore, I think it maintaince its essential purpose.

            <h2>Evaluation of TreeHouse's User Interface</h2>
         </header>
         <section>
               <p> The Treehouse is a online coding  website that I usually visit. I learned my web coding package,
               HTML/CSS and Javascript, from this website. First, it used a lots of colors to distinguish difference tracks
               of the courses which makes the user to get on the right track and take relative courses. Then the font of this
                site was a rounded font. It dose not look as formal as Times New Romans, so the users would feel relax when
                reading the contents. It also have some animations to make the website full of vim.</p>
