               <p> The Treehouse is a online coding  website that I usually visit. I learned my web coding package, HTML/CSS and Javascript, from this website. First, it used a lots of colors to distinguish difference tracks of the courses which makes the user to get on the right track and take relative courses. Then the font of this site was a rounded font. It dose not look as formal as Times New Romans, so the users would feel relax when reading the contents. It also have some animations to make the website full of vim.</p>
